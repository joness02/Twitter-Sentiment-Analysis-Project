# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Project

# Project Description

This project explores the sentiment analysis of Twitter entities using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains tweets and their corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral) for various entities such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

The project involves the following steps:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The raw data is cleaned and preprocessed by removing stopwords, special characters, and numbers, and converting the text to lowercase.

- Feature Extraction: Text features are extracted from the preprocessed data using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec.

- Model Building: Various machine learning models such as Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes are trained on the preprocessed data and their performance is compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Overall, this project aims to provide insights into the sentiment of Twitter entities using machine learning techniques and to demonstrate how these techniques can be applied in a real-world scenario.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset provides a valuable resource for sentiment analysis tasks related to social media data. In this challenge, we have explored various machine learning models to predict the sentiment of Twitter entities, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Among these models, the Random Forest Classifier has shown the highest accuracy in predicting sentiment on this dataset. However, there is still room for improvement, and future work can explore more advanced techniques such as deep learning or leveraging external data sources to further enhance the performance of sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Overall, this challenge has demonstrated the importance of sentiment analysis in understanding public opinion and the potential of machine learning in automating this task.
